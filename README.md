# Predicting Florida Dropout Rates with Machine Learnning
## ABSTRACT
Earning a high school diploma has become a necessity in today’s society. Previous studies have found that machine learning techniques can be utilized to predict high-school dropout and allow early intervention. This study seeks to discover and understand factors related to the student dropout rate in the state of Florida. Features were gathered from the Florida Department of Education and the United States Census Bureau’s databases. The features selected are pulled from the county level due to limited resources. Utilizing the information available from open data sources, nearly accurate prediction models were created. Multiple types of machine learning methods were used to evaluate the data. Naive Bayesian achieved an accuracy of 71.648%. Since the information was retrieved from the county level, lower-level data could be applied to the models and examined.
